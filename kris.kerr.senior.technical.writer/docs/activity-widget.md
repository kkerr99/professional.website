Use the Activity widget to display objects created, edited, or viewed by the user. For a given object, you can drill down to display more details and then jump directly to editing the object workflow.

This widget can display the following objects:
- AML projects
- Interactions
- Audiences
- Rules
- Offers (directly previewing offers). This behavior is slightly different than the other objects in the Activity widget. For other objects, a **View** option takes you to the view workflow for that object in the associated app. The **Preview Offer** option keeps the user in the Widget dashboard.
