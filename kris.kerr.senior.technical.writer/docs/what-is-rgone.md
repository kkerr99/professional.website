## What is the rgOne documentation set?

My last job was with [Redpoint Global](https://www.redpointglobal.com/). After I wrote two PDF-based manuals for Redpoint ([Master Data Management User Guide](https://kris-kerr-senior-technical-writer.netlify.app/assets/files/redpoint-master-data-management-user-guide-d618d3c775be8fac8257e1ee5c061c3b.pdf) and [Automated Machine Learning User Guide](https://kris-kerr-senior-technical-writer.netlify.app/assets/files/redpoint-aml-user-guide-259b6efe7aecc539a9c517d4ce2b408a.pdf)) the company switched to static docs site-based documentation (based upon my recommendation and a prototype Docusaurus static docs site I created as a demonstration).

I wrote the rgOne static site documentation for Redpoint's rgOne product, which was a collection of SaaS apps stitched together into one framework. At the time I wrote this documentation the rgOne apps were Automated Machine Learning (AML, which I had previously documented as a standalone app), Campaign Creation (which was still being developed and I hadn’t documented yet), and Customer View (which apparently I had just started documenting because the help system has only one topic for it). Customer View was later rebranded as Ambit and I [created a video](https://kris-kerr-senior-technical-writer.netlify.app/assets/files/ambit-demo-prototype-1-cf5e78426281153b8c8c25882b0edd1d.mp4) that described what it did and how to use it. I created the video on my own time as a prototype for a series of "how-to" videos to be posted on the rgOne static docs site. One of the reasons I wanted to switch to static docs sites at Redpoint was the ability to easily include video content.

The following static docs site content is from an early version of the rgOne static docs site, originally authored in Docusaurus (and also recreated here on a Docusaurus static docs site). I wrote all of this rgOne content myself. The content was reviewed by the developers and product manager. The AML content was repurposed from the PDF user guide I had previously written. Most of the other site content at that point in time revolved around explaining how the rgOne UI worked, how to navigate the UI, how to do user management, and explaining the underlying widget construction and how to use and modify widgets.
